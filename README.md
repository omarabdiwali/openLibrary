# Open Library

This website is a little library that I made using ReactJS. The data from the books are pulled from the Google Books API, and was styled 
using Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS. The home page shows the current Top 10 New York Times Best Sellers, and you have the ability to search, 
showing you the 20 most relevant searches according to Google Books.
